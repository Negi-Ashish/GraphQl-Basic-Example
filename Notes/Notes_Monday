Should i install this ?
	Ganache
	Truffle (Install with npm i truffle -g)
	JavaScript for testing
	Solidity for smart contract code


Terminology:
Node –  Nodes store data so that we can easily query the state of the blockchain
	to get the data we need
	
	
Block – A a group or a network of interconnected nodes are referred to as a block;
	for example, a network of different Ethereum nodes is called the Ethereum blockchain
	
	
Blockchain – a decentralized peer-to-peer network consisting of a series of blocks.
	     The first block is usually called the genesis block, and each subsequent
	     block has a reference to the block that came before it, with no central 
	     authority, and each peer playing a role in keeping the chain alive and
	     competing for what transactions to include in the next block
	     
	     
Transactions – these are more or less instructions from one account to another that are
 	       signed in a cryptographical manner for the sake of security;
 	       transactions usually causea change in the state of the blockchain.
 	       
RPC :-		Remote Procedure Call is a software communication protocol that one program 
		can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a
		network without having to understand the network's details. RPC is used to 
		call other processes on the remote systems like a local system.

EVM :-  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a virtual component that is contained in every
 	Ethereum node and is able to execute bytecode for contracts.
 	Smart contracts are usually written in high-level languages like Solidity and are then 
 	converted into EVM bytecode.
 	
 	
parentHash: It is simply the hash of a previous block.


ABI :-  Application Binary Interface(ABI) in Ethereum Virtual Machine.
	Blockchain | Smart Contracts.
